<!-- As a graduate student in the WISPO lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I spend much of my time in computer labs writing code or writing reports.  My hobbies keep me outside year round to counterbalance research with spending time outdoors.  The spring and fall are mostly for disc golf and rock climbing, the winter is for cross-country skiing, and the summer is dominated by my role as a captain for an Ultimate Frissbee team in the MUFA league.  Biking is of course a year-round sport in Madison, Wisconsin. -->
