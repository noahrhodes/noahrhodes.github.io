abstract: With increasing levels of distributed energy resources (DERs) connected
  to the grid, it is important to understand the role that DERs can play in post-disaster
  restoration. In this paper, we propose a two-step optimization method to identify
  and implement an optimal restoration schedule under different DER operating scenarios.
  We investigate how the presence and geographical distribution of DERs change the
  optimal restoration order, and assess the impacts on customers with and without
  DERs. In our case study using the IEEE 123 single phase distribution system, we
  find that optimal restoration order changes significantly when DERs are concentrated
  in one part of the grid. We also observe that the presence of DERs generally reduces
  the energy not served across all customers and can help prioritize grid reconnection
  of customers without DERs.
