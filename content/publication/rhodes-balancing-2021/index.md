abstract: Electric grid faults can ignite catastrophic wildfires, particularly in
  regions with high winds and low humidity. In real-time operations, electric utilities
  have few options for wildfire risk mitigation, leading to use of disruptive measures
  such as proactive de-energization of equipment, frequently referred to as public
  safety power shut-offs. Such power shut-offs have significant impacts on customers,
  who experience power cuts in an attempt to protect them from fires. This work proposes
  the optimal power shut-off problem, an optimization model to support short-term
  operational decision making in the context of extreme wildfire risk. Specifically,
  the model optimizes grid operations to maximize the amount of power that can be
  delivered, while proactively minimizing the risk of wildfire ignitions by selectively
  de-energizing components in the grid. This is the first optimization model to consider
  how preventive wildfire risk measures impact both wildfire risk and power systems
  reliability at a short-term, operational time-frame. The effectiveness of the method
  is demonstrated on an augmented version of the RTS-GMLC test case, located in Southern
  California, and compared against two approaches based on simple risk thresholds.
  The proposed optimization-based model reduces both wildfire risk and lost load shed
  relative to the benchmarks.
