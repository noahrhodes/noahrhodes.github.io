	abstract = {With increasing levels of distributed energy resources (DERs) connected to the grid, it is important to understand the role that DERs can play in post-disaster restoration. In this paper, we propose a two-step optimization method to identify and implement an optimal restoration schedule under different DER operating scenarios. We investigate how the presence and geographical distribution of DERs change the optimal restoration order, and assess the impacts on customers with and without DERs. In our case study using the IEEE 123 single phase distribution system, we find that optimal restoration order changes significantly when DERs are concentrated in one part of the grid. We also observe that the presence of DERs generally reduces the energy not served across all customers and can help prioritize grid reconnection of customers without DERs.},

	abstract = {With the escalating frequency of extreme grid disturbances, such as natural disasters, comes an increasing need for efficient recovery plans. Algorithms for optimal power restoration play an important role in developing such plans, but also give rise to challenging mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems, where tractable solution methods are not yet available. To assist in research on such solution methods, this work proposes PowerModelsRestoration, a flexible, open-source software framework for rapidly designing and testing power restoration algorithms. PowerModelsRestoration constructs a mathematical modeling layer for formalizing core restoration tasks that can be combined to develop complex workflows and high performance heuristics. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated by proof-of-concept studies on three established cases from the literature, focusing on single-phase positive sequence network models. The results demonstrate that PowerModelsRestoration reproduces the established literature, and for the first time provide an analysis of restoration with nonlinear power flow models, which have not been previously considered.},

	abstract = {Electric grid faults can ignite catastrophic wildfires, particularly in regions with high winds and low humidity. In real-time operations, electric utilities have few options for wildfire risk mitigation, leading to use of disruptive measures such as proactive de-energization of equipment, frequently referred to as public safety power shut-offs. Such power shut-offs have significant impacts on customers, who experience power cuts in an attempt to protect them from fires. This work proposes the optimal power shut-off problem, an optimization model to support short-term operational decision making in the context of extreme wildfire risk. Specifically, the model optimizes grid operations to maximize the amount of power that can be delivered, while proactively minimizing the risk of wildfire ignitions by selectively de-energizing components in the grid. This is the first optimization model to consider how preventive wildfire risk measures impact both wildfire risk and power systems reliability at a short-term, operational time-frame. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on an augmented version of the RTS-GMLC test case, located in Southern California, and compared against two approaches based on simple risk thresholds. The proposed optimization-based model reduces both wildfire risk and lost load shed relative to the benchmarks.},
